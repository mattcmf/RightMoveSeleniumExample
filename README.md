**Setup/Instructions for new starters:**:
* Open Visual Studio

* In the solution explorer, right click on the project and select "Manage Nuget packages"
* Ensure the "Installed" tab is selected, then verify all Nugets in Tools are visible.
* Build project using (control + shift + B)
* Tests toolbar should be open on the left hand side
* Select Run All tests
* Setup is a example test and does not perform any verifications
* All tests (apart from negative scenarios) should run and pass (assuming there are no changes to the available houses)

**Out of scope:**:
* Unit and integration testing

**General Notes**
Spec says, user can search for houses **under** "300,000", opposed to houses **less than or equal** to 300,000. The website only offers a max option of 300,000. Meaning it is not possible to enter less than 300,000 without also including 300,000. This may be a potential issue and should be queried with the subject matter expert.
